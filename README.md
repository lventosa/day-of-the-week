# Day of the week

Do you know which day of the week it was the day you were born? Do you want to know if a specific day is going to fall on a weekend? But most importantly, can you know this without checking the calendar?

There are plenty of algorithms that allow you to know the day of the week of a given date. Even though this program is not the most computationally efficient, it is the most friendly to the human brain. You can run the code on your computer or use it to learn to calculate the day of the week mentally. 

The algorithm can only be performed with dates belonging to the Gregorian calendar. More concretely, this program only works for dates between 1st January 1600 and 31st December 2399.
